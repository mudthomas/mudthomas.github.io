The paper bobbins that came with the DMC storage box broke too easily. I first printed a design I found on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com) and even remixed it a bit, but ultimately I decided to design my own. Bobbins usually have two slits for thread, but my wife likes the 'floss drop' method and requested that I added extra holes instead of the slits.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/projects/dropbob_design1.PNG" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/projects/dropbob_design2.PNG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/projects/dropbob_slice2.PNG"  title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

This was the first design I did in FreeCAD and it was a fun learning experience. The bobbin was sliced in FlashPrint 5 and printed using a Flashforge Finder at my local library.
