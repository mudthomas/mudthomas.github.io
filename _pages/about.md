I am a recently graduated mathematician with a Masters' degree from [Lunds University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se). The specialization of both my BSc and MSc were in Numerical Analysis which I love. I genuinely enjoy optimizing code, and working with efficient algorithms. Before I studied mathematics I worked as an at-home carer for Ekens Assistans.

During my numerical analysis courses all coding was done in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), a language I now consider myself fluent in. When I want to code something in my spare time, it is always my go-to language. I have also taken university entire courses in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) and [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)). Apart from these I have also coded in [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) as part of a statistics course, I have written a lot of texts in [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) and also done some presentations in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter#Jupyter_Notebook). In a course on mathematical modelling I did linear programming in [Excel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel). During my Master's thesis I made models in [Modelica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelica) and worked with code in [Cython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cython). For my thesis work, and also in one or two other courses, I studied and reworked Fortran code, but I have never written my own projects in [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran). I am currently learning the scripting language [AutoHotKey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoHotkey) for a small project automating some farming elements of a video game.


I like spending my free time in the woods, preferably in VÃ¤sterbotten, picking berries with my wife. I believe that the fact that we have have half a freezer full of cloudberries should stand as a testament to my ability to work through hard problems, bogs and mosquitos with tenacity.

This site is currently a work in progress. All information should be about me, but the template uses Albert Einstein as a place holder, so if some information seem to describe him better than me that is probably the reason. My old website, that was built using my own html instead of Jekyll, is still available [here](/oldsite/index.html), and it should not contain a single piece of information about dr. Einstein.

Under 'cv' you can find a JSON-resume version of my personal CV. A pdf edition of the CV is also available in [English](/assets/pdf/CV_Thomas_Renstrom_en.pdf) and [Swedish](/assets/pdf/CV_Thomas_Renstrom_sv.pdf). As well as my cover letter in [Swedish](/assets/pdf/personligt_brev.pdf). An English version of my cover letter is in the works!
