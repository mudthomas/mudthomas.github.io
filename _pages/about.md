I am a recently graduated mathematician with a Masters' degree from [Lunds University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se). The specialization of both my BSc and MSc were in Numerical Analysis which I love. I genuinely enjoy optimizing code, and working with efficient algorithms. Before I studied mathematics I worked as an at-home carer for Ekens Assistans.

During my numerical analysis courses all coding was done in [Python](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>), a language I now consider myself fluent in. When I want to code something in my spare time, it is always my go-to language. I have also taken university entire courses in [Java](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)>) and [C](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>). Apart from these I have also coded in [R](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)>) as part of a statistics course, I have written a lot of texts in [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) and also done some presentations in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter#Jupyter_Notebook). In a course on mathematical modelling I did linear programming in [Excel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel). During my Master's thesis I made models in [Modelica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelica) and worked with code in [Cython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cython). For my thesis work, and also in one or two other courses, I studied and reworked Fortran code, but I have never written my own projects in [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran).

Currently I work as a consultant developer for Knowit Connectivity. Since April of 2025 I am part of a consultant team for Ericsson AB where we develop telecom features in C and tests for these features in Python.

I like spending my free time in the woods, preferably in Västerbotten, picking berries with my wife. I believe that the fact that we have have half a freezer full of cloudberries should stand as a testament to my ability to work through hard problems, bogs and mosquitos with tenacity.

Under 'cv' you can find a JSON-resume version of my personal CV. A pdf edition of the CV is also available in [English](/assets/pdf/CV_Thomas_Renstrom_en.pdf) and [Swedish](/assets/pdf/CV_Thomas_Renstrom_sv.pdf). As well as my cover letter in [Swedish](/assets/pdf/personligt_brev.pdf). An English version of my cover letter is in the works!
