This site is currently a work in progress. Some information will NOT be correctly filled in. The template uses Albert Einstein as a place holder, so if some information seem to describe him better than Thomas Renstr√∂m, that is probably the reason.
My old website, that was built using my own html instead of Jekyll, is still available [here](/oldsite/index.html), and it should not contain a single piece of information about dr. Einstein.

Under 'cv' you can find a JSON-resume version of my personal CV. A pdf edition of the CV is also available in [English](/assets/pdf/CV_Thomas_Renstrom_en.pdf) and [Swedish](/assets/pdf/CV_Thomas_Renstrom_sv.pdf). As well as my cover letter in [Swedish](/assets/pdf/personligt_brev.pdf). An English version of my cover letter is in the works!

This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
