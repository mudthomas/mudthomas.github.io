This site is currently a work in progress. Some information will NOT be correctly filled in. The template uses Albert Einstein as a place holder, so if some information seem to describe him better than Thomas Renstr√∂m, that is probably the reason.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com).

This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
